Implementation of the DL-ELM network architecture
This repository contains an implementation of the sparse convolutional neural network using alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) introduced by F. Kiaee, C. Gagn√©, and M. Abbasi. The original paper can be found at
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.011)

## Contents

1. Python implementation of ADMM-based sparse CNN (ADMM.py)
2. A module that constructs the network in network (NIN) graph in tensorflow and loads the pretrained weights (ADMMmodels.py)
3. (DL_ELM_demo.m)

For the record, it gets about 80% accuracy on the 
test set. 3. Spect benchmark dataset for demonstration (SPECT.train.txt, SPECT.test.txt)
